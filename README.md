These are just a few of the apps that I created while in the software guild. I should say
that they were created in the order of Battleship, Flooring Mastery, and DVD Library. 

Battleship is a Console Application that plays through the familiar game of battleship.

Flooring Mastery was created to test my knowledge of C#. I have to say this project was
a gamechanger for me. It was very inspiring and I have learned a lot from it.

DVD Library was made to illustrate my knowledge of MVC and some front-end capabilities. 
I particularly had fun with the jQuery plugin rateYo. It was a challenge to figure out 
how to use for my needs in its implementation.

These projects continue to be a work in progress I enjoy revisiting them to see what 
I have learned. Please if you have any questions feel free to email me.
